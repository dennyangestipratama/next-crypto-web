# Cryptocurrency Price Live Website

## Introduction

This website is a platform to display the live price of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. It was built using Next.js, React Hooks, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React-Query. The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a great user experience on any device.

## Technology Stack

The following technologies were used in the development of this website:

- Next.js: A React-based framework for building server-side rendered and statically exported web applications.

- React Hooks: A feature in React that allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

- TypeScript: A statically typed programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding types to the language.

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

- React-Query: A library for managing and caching asynchronous data in React.

- Yarn: A package manager for JavaScript projects.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dennyangestipratama/next-crypto-web.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   `bash
    yarn dev
    `
   The website should now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
